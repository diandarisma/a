I am a PhD student at the Laboratory of Earth Resources Geomechanic, Department of Environmental Studies for Advanced Society, Tohoku University. My research focuses on induced seismicity that is triggered during injection. We want to extract fractures network based on microseismic clusters distribution.<br>
I am also interested in other geophysical methods (gravity, magnetic, geoelectrical) to solve environmental issues and hazards.
