I am a PhD student at Laboratory of Earth Resources Geomechanic, Department of Enviromental Studies for Advanced Society, Tohoku University. My research focus on induced seismicity that is triggered during injection.<br>
I am also interested in other geophysical methods (gravity, magnetic, geoelectrical) applied for earth resources exploration and hazard.
