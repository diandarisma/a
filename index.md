I am a PhD student at Laboratory of Earth Resources Geomechanic, Department of Enviromental Studies for Advanced Society, Tohoku University. My research focus on Induced Seismicity that happen during production or injection of geothermal fluid.
I love to learn about Geophysics so I can get better understanding about Earth.
